# Pirate_Crew

A MERN exam from [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/).

I had 5 hours to implement the featurs before deployment on AWS\(currently inactive\).

I was allowed to begin the exam with some code already prepared.

This website creates users validated by models to create a "crew."

The crew list is ordered alphabetically and each crew mate has full CRUD capabilities.
