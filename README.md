# Pirate_Crew

A fun app to create the perfect pirate crew.

Give each crew mate a name, postion, quote, and decide if they should have a peg leg, hook, and/or eye patch!

The About page of each pirate shows their details and lets you change their looks by editing if they have an eye patch, peg leg, or hook.

If you need to remove a pirate have them Walk the Plank! They're organized alphabetically so it's easy to find who you're looking for.

And it's responsive so you can build your crew on the go!
